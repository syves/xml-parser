$ initdb pg
$ postgres -D pg &

$ createdb testdb

$psql testedb
testdb=# create role hans with superuser;

#dump sql data into db
psql testdb --file="/Users/syves/github.com/syves/largeFiles/person.sql"

#check number of inserts
testdb=# select count(`*`) from person;

#create index took 4 mins and is not reccomended for db with frequent inserts and updates!
testdb=# create index person_idx on person (fname, lname, dob);
